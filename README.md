## Summary
This repository contains the CAD designs for the **Robotic Fire Extinguishment System (RFES)**. These files were created using **Autodesk Fusion 360** and include all the 3D models necessary for constructing the hardware components of the project.

## Contents
- **Chassis and Mounts**: Designs for the system's base, servo mounts, and structural components.  
- **Camera and Sensor Holders**: Custom mounts for the Raspberry Pi camera and other sensors used in the system.  
- **Pump, Battery, and Servo Fixtures**: Supports and brackets for securely housing the water pump, lithium-ion batteries, and servo motors.  
- **Reservoir and Connector Components**: Designs for the water reservoir and connectors used in the system's plumbing.
